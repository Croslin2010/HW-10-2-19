When viewing data visually it is important to remember the four elements and how they effect the data and our perception of it.  When looking at the level of data it is important to take note of the exact numbers used as well at the exact variables being represented and how they would relate with one another.  When looking at spread it is revealed how wide data can be, for example we can look at the example of the presidential approval rating and see that just because someone has reached higher scores doesn't mean that they don't also have the lowest.  When looking at shape it becomes clear what data means on a large scale for example we can start to see areas where test scores are lower rather than just knowing what average test scores are.  When finding exceptions one must use large amounts of data or they will be hidden.  Exceptions are occurances in data that are outside the norm and aren't as apperant when smaller samples are taken.
